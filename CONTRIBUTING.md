# üöÄ Contributing to ImChatty

Welcome, and thanks for your interest in contributing to **NuxtChat**! üéâ  
We appreciate your help in improving this open-source chat platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

We only accept contributions through **forks and pull requests** to the `opensource` branch.

Before opening a pull request for the new integration, open an issue to discuss
said integration with the NuxtChat team. After discussing the integration, you can
get started on it. 

### Be mindful of your commits

Try to make simple PRs that handle one specific topic. Just like for reporting
issues, it's better to open 3 different PRs that each address a different issue
than one big PR with three commits. This makes it easier to review, approve, and
merge the changes independently.

When updating your fork with upstream changes, please use ``git pull --rebase``
to avoid creating "merge commits". Those commits unnecessarily pollute the git
history when coming from PRs.

Also try to make commits that bring the application from one stable state to another
stable state, i.e. if your first commit has a bug that you fixed in the second
commit, try to merge them together before making your pull request. This
includes fixing build issues or typos, adding documentation, etc.
